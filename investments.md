# My Investments
This page gives a short overview of my investments. I invest primarily to build 
additional income for my retirement. All my investments are long-term, with
exceptions of experiments I conduct to evaluate different asset classes. 

This page is a report of what I am doing and 
**does not constituted investment advice in any form**.


## General Strategy
I follow a passive investment strategy and try to avoid stock picking and market
timing. I primarily invest in broadly diversified ETFs on the stock indices

+ MSCI World (70%)
+ MSCI Emerging Markets (30%)

for more than 90% of my investments. I am currently evaluating options for
more sustainable and environmentally friendly indices here.

I also like to experiment with other asset classes and have smaller positions
of less than 5% of my overall portfolio in

+ P2P- and Crowd-Investments 
+ REITs
+ Commodities
+ Express certificates
