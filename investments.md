# My Investments
This page gives a short overview of my investment strategy. It is a pure report
and **does not constitue investment advice in any form**.


## General Stategy
I follow a passive investment stategy and try to avoid stock picking and market
timing. I primarily invest in broad ETFs and aim for a classical and boring 
combination of 

+ 70% MSCI World
+ 30% MSCI Emerging Markets

for more than 90% of my investments.

I also like to experiment with other asset classes and have smaller positions
of (less than 5% each) in

+ P2P- and Crowd-Investments 
+ REITs 
+ Comodities
+ Express certificates
