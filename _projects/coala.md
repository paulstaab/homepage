`Coala` is an `R` framework for coalescent simulation. It can
be used to specify and simulated biological models of 
evolution. The models are build in a modular approach, and
`coala` automatically calls different existing coalescent
simulators and parse their results. It is the most sophisticated
`R` package I have written so far.
