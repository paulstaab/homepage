There are certain situations when you need to work with temporary files in R.
For instance, my package Jaatha requires that an external simulation tool is
called, which writes it's results into files. However, reading and writing to
disk is really slow compared to data in memory, and hence the use of many
temporary files can be a severe performance bottleneck. 

However, there is an solution easy for this on (reasonably modern) Linux systems, at least in
case the files fit into memory. There normally is a memory disk available under
/run/shm, /var/run/shm or /dev/shm, e.g. a file system that behaves like a 'normal'
file system in any way, but saves the files into memory. Usually, can check
whether you have such a memory disk available doing a
{% highlight bash %}
df -h | grep shm
{% endhighlight %}

You can tell R to place it's temporary file in this directory by setting the
TMPDIR environment variable before starting R:
{% highlight bash %}
TMPDIR=/path/to/shm R
{% endhighlight %}
This affects only the started R session. 
If you want to make the change permanently, add a line like
{% highlight bash %}
TMPDIR=${TMPDIR-/path/to/shm}
{% endhighlight %}
to your ~/.Renviron file.

To see if it works, check the output of  
{% highlight r %}
tempdir()
{% endhighlight %}
in R.

_Update 04.02.2014_: Changed .Renviron file so that it does not overwrite
existing values of $TMPDIR.
