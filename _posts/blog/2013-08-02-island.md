I just came back from an awesome trip to Iceland. 
I have been there for almost three weeks, 
circling the island once and spending a few days 
near Reykjavik afterwards.

Iceland is a beautiful country. It is very sparsely populated 
outside of the region around Reykjavik, although there are many 
single farms at least every few kilometers in the lowlands. 
Also a lot of geologically interesting places - glaciers, 
volcanos, many waterfalls and hot springs - are definitely worth a visit.

I rented a car for most of the trip, which is quite expensive in Iceland, 
but gives you a lot of flexibility during the travel. It would have been 
better to rent a Jeep as you are not allowed to drive on highland roads 
with a normal car. 
Unfortunately jeeps - which are required for driving through the highlands - 
are almost unaffordable, even when shared by multiple people. Another possibility 
is traveling by bus. I don't recommend exploring Iceland on a bike, unless 
you absolutely love to bike, mind neither frequent rain, strong wind nor 
driving on roads more frequented than you would expect. I camped wildly most 
of the time, even thought campsites are relatively cheap (around 1000ISK/6â‚¬ per person and night).

A particular highlight for me was a whale watching trip we did in Hauganes, where we spotted 
several humpback and minke whales. I strongly recommend doing one of those. Apart 
from that make sure to visit as many public hot pools as possible. They are an 
integral part of Icelandic culture, and kind of a central meeting point for Icelanders.

As travel guide I found that the [book by Jens Willhardt and Christine Sadler](http://www.amazon.de/Island-Jens-Willhardt/dp/3899536894) 
was by far the most useful of several alternatives I used. 

If you are reading this because you are going to Iceland, then enjoy your trip! I'm jealous :-)
