I started playing with 
[r-travis](https://github.com/craigcitro/r-travis) today. It's a nice project
from Craig Citro that makes it quite easy to use 
[Travis CI](http://travis-ci.com/) to automatically build and test R packages
on GitHub. It's quite easy to set up, just follow the outline in the repo's
readme. I though quite a bit on how I could ensure that I cannot forget to run
[Jaatha's](https://github.com/paulstaab/jaatha) integration tests, as
they take much to long to be included in the package, and travis seems to be the
perfect place for that.

You can also set up travis to push generated files back to github. I tried using
this to automatically build up-to-date vignettes. Jaatha's vignettes however
take to long to build, even for travis...
