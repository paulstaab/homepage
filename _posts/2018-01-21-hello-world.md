Hello there!

It has been a while. I closed my blog and removed all old posts from my
Website at some point in 2015. That was in the middle of my PhD,
and I had do a lot of writing at that time and could not find the motivation to
keep the blog running. It was missing a clear topic and focus anyway.

A lot has changed for me since then. I finally finished my PhD and now
work [in industry](https://www.mvise.de/) as a Data Scientist. As a consultant
I travel quite frequently and get to see many companies from the inside. I
learn a lot, not only about classical Data Science topics like Machine Learning
and Big Data handling, but also about consulting, business problems and
commination. And I hardly do any long format writing anymore.

It turned out that Data Science is a pretty exiting field at the moment. It is rapidly
maturing from ad hoc analytics and reporting to creating data driven products
and services. Don't get me wrong, analytics and reporting is still an incredibly
important aspect for every company, but creating software which reliably processes
previously unseen data is quite a different story from executing an analysis in R or Python
on a particular dataset. And, there is of course deep learning and the hipe about
Artificial Intelligence. In my first year in industry, a lot of my work was about
creating proof-of-concepts that demonstrated that Machine Learning can provide
a net positive business value for companies - meaning that the benefits of an
application outweigh the cost of creating and running it. That changed in my
second year, where the focus gradually shifted to actually creating and deploying
Machine Learning Models as part of applications.

I found that the process for deploying a model "to production" is a lot more
challenging that it seemed to me at first glance. There are many things
that can go wrong if your must work unsupervised on new data, and you must
anticipate as many of them as possible. You have to meet runtime requirements,
possibly creating predictions in real-time. You have to
implement tests, logging, versioning and many other best practices from the DevOps
world, continuously measure the performance of your model, retrain it frequently
and think about avoiding feedback loops.

I the future, I will write here about my journey further into the topic of using
Machine Learning in production. I am planning to write about my personal experience
at customers (when I am allowed to), review related academic papers and software tools, and
hopefully will find the time to conduct some small experiments and comparisons
myself. As this is one of the more advanced topics in Data Science, I will assume
that you as reader are familiar with key concepts in Data Science and Machine Learning.
My goal is to write about one post per month. If you are interested, you can
subscribe to the [RSS feed](https://paulstaab.de/feed.xml) or follow me on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/paulstaab) or
[LinkedIn](https://de.linkedin.com/in/paulstaab), where I will share new posts as well.

Thatâ€™s it for now. Hope you stay tuned for the next post!

Best wishes,
Paul
