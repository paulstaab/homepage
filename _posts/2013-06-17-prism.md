The third post 
in my blog here back in 2010 was about my search for alternatives to the popular
Google groupware (GMail, GCal, Google Contacts etc) that I used to manage my
personal information at that time. These plans were
motived by a vague feeling that Google might at some point start to misuse my
personal data. The recent revelations about PRISM proved that this feeling was more
than justified.

Luckily I have slowly migrated away from Google's products to self hosted open source
replacements. Today, I run my own little server at home, a
[Seagate Dockstar](http://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv5/seagate-dockstar) 
running [Debian GNU/Linux](http://www.debian.org). 
This works astonishingly well, even
so the Dockstar only has a single 1.2
GHz ARM CPU and 128MB memory (i.e. only little more than nothing). It runs my own
mail server replacing Gmail and a webserver with [ownCloud](http://owncloud.org) 
that I use for syncing
my contacts and calendars. I don't use ownCloud for syncing my files, many due
to some bad experience I had with it. Don't get me wrong, I really like the project, but
some parts of it -- including the file sync -- are not mature
enough for regular use at the moment. Instead, I sync my files via ssh using the awesome tool
Unison.  

Running your own server at home has some advantages. Paradoxically, in Germany your data is
is more difficult to access for federal agencies if it is physically placed in
your own apartment, rather than on a rented server in a proper server farm. And I
don't have to trust a hosting company. On the other hand it has the disadvantage that it is behind
a dynamic ip and dyndns can be quite painful. IPv6 via 
[sixxs.com](https://www.sixxs.net) partly solves
this problem. Also, the slow upstream connection
that you usually get in Germany (which is downstream from the servers point of view)
slows down file transfers dramatically. I guess it is more expensive than a
vServer, in particular if you want hardware that is not as slow as the Dockstar.
And finally you still need an offside backup for your data.

I'm still looking for a replacement for Google Reader, which I found hardest to
leave. Luckily, Google is now shutting down this awesome service, forcing me to
finally abandon it. I'm still trying to get used to
[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com), which I find
much harder to use than the Google Search. Guess this demonstrates that Google
still knows me well. So the last pieces that keeps Google (and the NSA) well
informed about myself are Google+ and my Android phone. The latter runs
Cyanogen Mod anyway, so it
would be possible to operate it completely without Google. But this would require abandoning
the Play Store as well, which is not an option for me in the moment. I will
try to migrate slowly to Open Source Apps provided by
[F-Droid](http://f-droid.org), so that I might
be able to [free my android](https://fsfe.org/campaigns/android) in the future.

Even though I and many others always suspected what was now revealed about
PRISM, it made me think about privacy again. Should I delete my Facebook and
Google Plus accounts? Are the any alternatives? [App.net](https://app.net) is also
located in the US, and is not adopted as widely by far. How to you handle your
personal information? Do you just go on using Google, the iCloud or stuff on
Mircosoft's servers? I'm grateful for any input here.
